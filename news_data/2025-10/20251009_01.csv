A 13-year-old herder, Abubakar Wada, was fatally shot while tending to his family's cattle around the Inzon community in Fan district, Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State. The attackers, described by Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) as Berom militias, opened fire indiscriminately, killing 36 cattle and leaving 49 missing. The incident unfolded in the evening, exacerbating longstanding herdsmen-farmer conflicts rooted in resource scarcity and land disputes. This attack has claimed one human life and significant economic loss for the nomadic community, which relies heavily on livestock for livelihood. Local leaders from both sides have traded accusations, with herders claiming targeted persecution and farmers alleging trespassing. Security forces arrived post-attack but no arrests were made immediately. Such clashes have intensified in recent years due to climate change-induced migration and weak governance. Over 80 cattle losses reported highlight the vulnerability of pastoralists. Advocacy groups call for dialogue and equitable resource management to prevent escalation into broader violence.
