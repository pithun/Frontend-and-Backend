Described as the most hazardous in the South, this route has seen numerous incidents of banditry, gunmen attacks, and kidnappings, making travel risky for commuters. Ore, a key transit point connecting Lagos to other parts of the region, has been a hotspot for armed robberies and ambushes by criminals who exploit the highway's vulnerabilities.

Eyewitness accounts and social media amplify calls for reinforced operations, better equipping of vigilante groups, and federal support. The broader context reveals a pattern where highways become no-go zones, disrupting commerce and daily life.
