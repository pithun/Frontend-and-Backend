This persistent criminality contributes to a medium-threat environment, where residents live in fear of sudden violence. Efforts to curb this include community policing, but underreporting due to fear persists. The discussion highlights the need for comprehensive strategies beyond political agitation to address root causes like poverty and unemployment driving armed robbery and kidnapping.",
